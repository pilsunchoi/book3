    "Once you've built the HTML for your book, you can host it online.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with a service that hosts **static websites**\n",
    "(because that's what you have just created with Jupyter Book).\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll cover how to publish your book online with **GitHub Pages**, a popular and free online hosting platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create an online repository for your book\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to connect your hosted book with your book's source content, you should put your book's source content in a public repository. This section describes one approach to create your own GitHub repository and add your book's content to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, log in to GitHub, then go to the \"create a new repository\" page: <https://github.com/new>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, give your online repository a name and a description. Make your repository public and do not initialize it with a README file, then click \"Create repository\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, clone the (currently empty) online repository to a location on your local computer. You can do this via the command line with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   (base) C:\\>git clone https://github.com/pilsunchoi/book1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Copy all of your book files and folders into this newly cloned repository. For example, if you created your book locally with `jupyter-book create mylocalbook` and your new repository is called `myonlinebook`, you could do this via the command line with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Mac (?)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   cp -r mylocalbook/* myonlinebook/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- For Windows\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   (base) C:\\>robocopy C:\\DataScience C:\\book1 /e \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "      (나의 노트북에 \\book1이 만들어지고 거기에 C:\\DataScience의 모든 것(/e: 빈 디렉토리를 포함하여 모든 하위 디렉토리) 복사됨.\n",
    "      \n",
    "5. Now you need to sync your local and remote (i.e., online) repositories. You can do this with the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   (base) C:\\>cd book1\n",
    "   (base) C:\\book1>git add ./*\n",
    "   (base) C:\\book1>git commit -m \"adding my first book!\"\n",
    "   (base) C:\\book1>git push\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publish your book online with GitHub Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just pushed the *source files* for our book into our GitHub repository.\n",
    "This makes it publicly accessible for you or others to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll publish the *build artifact* of our book online, so that it is rendered as a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to use GitHub Pages with your built HTML is to use the [`ghp-import`](https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import) package. `ghp-import` is a lightweight Python package that makes it easy to push HTML content to a GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ghp-import` works by copying *all* of the contents of your built book (i.e., the `_build/html` folder) to a branch of your repository called `gh-pages`, and pushes it to GitHub. The `gh-pages` branch will be created and populated automatically for you by `ghp-import`. To use `ghp-import` to host your book online with GitHub Pages follow the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Before performing the below steps, ensure that HTML has been built for each page of your book (see {doc}`the previous section <../start/build>`). There should be a collection of HTML files in your book's `_build/html` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install `ghp-import`\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   (base) C:\\>pip install ghp-import\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Update the settings for your GitHub pages site:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Use the `gh-pages` branch to host your website.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Choose root directory `/` if you're building the book in it's own repository.\n",
    "       Choose `/docs` directory if you're building documentation with jupyter-book.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   * ChatGPT: 브랜치가 `gh-pages`에 없는 경우: `gh-pages` 브랜치를 먼저 생성하고 배포 내용을 푸시해야 합니다.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (base) C:\\book1>git checkout -b gh-pages\n",
    "   (base) C:\\book1>git push origin gh-pages\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From the `main` branch of your book's root directory (which should contain the `_build/html` folder) call `ghp-import` and point it to your HTML files, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   (base) C:\\book1>ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    ">Make sure that you included the `-n` - this tells GitHub *not* to build your book with\n",
    "[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which we don't want because our HTML is already built!\n",
    "If you do not do this you may see **404 not found** for your deployed content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically after a few minutes your site should be viewable online at a url such as: `https://<user>.github.io/<myonlinebook>/`. If not, check your repository settings under **Options** -> **GitHub Pages** to ensure that the `gh-pages` branch is configured as the build source for GitHub Pages and/or to find the url address GitHub is building for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "To update your online book, make changes to your book's content on the `main` branch of your repository, re-build your book with `jupyter-book build mybookname/` and then use `ghp-import -n -p -f mylocalbook/_build/html` as before to push the newly built HTML to the `gh-pages` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note this warning from the [`ghp-import` GitHub repository](https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import):\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\"...*`ghp-import` will DESTROY your gh-pages branch... and assumes that the `gh-pages` branch is 100% derivative. You should never edit files in your `gh-pages` branch by hand if you're using this script...*\"\n",
